Simple seven segment display board, common cathode.

Looking at the display, 8 pins on the left

0 PE0
1 PE1
2 PE2
3 PE3
4 PE4
5 PE5
6 PE6
7 PE7

right side is the grounds from the top

0 PA0
1 PA1
2 PA2
3 PA3


Specifically I used these parts

HDSP-513G (green)
HDSP-513E (red)

I used 750Ohm resistors, I didnt want this too bright, built one with
130ohm to be a little brighter for a lit room.
