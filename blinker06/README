Interrupts are the LAST way you should learn to blink an led, never
the first.  This uses SYSTICK which is not quite the whole interrupt
story, its really an event not an interrupt, more work is required
to use interrupts (from say one of the timer peripherals).

The prior examples with the PLL were fun, but we dont need to go that
fast and are not using the USB peripheral, so straight up unmodified
external clock is best.  8MHz, an interrupt every 1million clocks
change the led state every 48 interrupts is 6 seconds per led state
change.
