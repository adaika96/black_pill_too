See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

PE0 on this board has an led.

Read all the warnings and stuff in blinker04/README, this
is derived from that make USB 48 and the system 48.

PLLM is 4

If we do a VCO of 192 we can divide that by 4 for USB and for MAIN

8 * (PLLN/4) = 192

PLLN = 96


PLLM 4
PLLN 96
PLLQ 4
PLLP 4

PPRE2 <90 not divided
PPRE1 <45 divide by 2
HPRE not divided

1 WS aggressive
2 WS conservative


if we count to 1 million 96 times per led state change that means the
led is on for 2 seconds and off for 2 seconds.
