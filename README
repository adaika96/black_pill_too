STM32F407VGT6 breakout board baremetal examples.

So if you google STM32 blue pill you find an inexpensive cortex-m3
based board.  You google STM32 black pill you find a similar one.

Well there is also a black board you find if you search for

STM32F407VGT6 board

on ebay or amazon.  I have been burned a few times on ebay now
with empty shipments and no way to recover, amazon two to three times
the price for the same board but already in the states your choice.

This one says diymroe (diymore mispelled) on the top and DIY MORE
on the bottom.  Website is bogus or doesnt work anymore.  Found
the schematic on google searches and dumb luck.

The button near the usb connector is reset.  On the other end of
that side of the board, with the usb up the lower left, it says
BOOT0BOOT1.  What is going on there is those pins on the side next
to those labels the pair at the end of the row if you put a jumper
across them that changes BOOT1.  Do that and press reset and then
dmesg (-c) and you should see something like

[431754.721749] usb 2-1.7.2: New USB device found, idVendor=0483, idProduct=df11
[431754.721752] usb 2-1.7.2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[431754.721755] usb 2-1.7.2: Product: STM32  BOOTLOADER
[431754.721756] usb 2-1.7.2: Manufacturer: STMicroelectronics
[431754.721758] usb 2-1.7.2: SerialNumber: 333333333333

apt-get install dfu-util

then you can do something like this

dfu-util -a 0 -s 0x08000000 -D blinker00.bin

Then move the jumper one set of pins over from the end and press reset
that shorts BOOT0 (to ground) and now our program runs.  Ill get to
serial loading (and jtag) later.
