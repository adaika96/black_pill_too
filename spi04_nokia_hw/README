I normally bit bang spi, this example uses the spi peripheral.

I have one of these

Can get them on ebay for much less, but can take a while to get here.

STM32 to Nokia 5110 display connections

PA7 DIN
PA5 CLK
PA4 CE
PA3 D/C
GND GND
VCC VCC
RST RST

I typically dont use the spi controller in these devices as it varies
so much from vendor to vendor or chip to chip.  But the docs were
pretty good and I had figured out a similar STM32 one by blinking
leds and having a huge divisor.
